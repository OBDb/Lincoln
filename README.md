## About Lincoln

Lincoln is the luxury vehicle division of American automobile manufacturer Ford. Founded in 1917 by Henry Leland and acquired by Ford in 1922, Lincoln has established itself as a premium American luxury automotive brand with a rich heritage of elegant design, advanced technology, and sophisticated comfort.

## Generations

Lincoln has evolved through several significant eras in its history:

- **Founding and Early Years (1917-1939)**: Lincoln was established by Henry Leland (who previously founded Cadillac) and was acquired by Ford Motor Company in 1922. During this period, Lincoln became known for its precisely engineered luxury automobiles, including the iconic Model L and Model K series, which competed with premium brands like Cadillac and Packard.

- **Continental Era (1940-1980s)**: The introduction of the Lincoln Continental in 1940 marked a new design direction for the brand. The 1956-1957 Continental Mark II became one of the most exclusive American luxury cars of its time. The 1961 Continental with its distinctive suicide doors became an enduring style icon and represented American luxury for decades.

- **Modern Luxury Period (1990s-2010)**: This era saw Lincoln attempt to redefine itself against growing competition from European and Japanese luxury brands. The Navigator, introduced in 1998, became Lincoln's first SUV and one of its most successful models, while vehicles like the LS sedan aimed to appeal to younger luxury buyers.

- **Transformation Era (2010-Present)**: Lincoln underwent a comprehensive brand reinvention, moving away from traditional luxury to what it calls "quiet luxury." This period introduced the MKZ, MKC, Continental revival, Aviator, and Nautilus models. The brand also expanded globally, particularly into the Chinese market, and has embraced new technologies including advanced driver assistance systems and electrification.
